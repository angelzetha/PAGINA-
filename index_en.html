                <p> An external CSS style sheet can be applied to any number of HTML documents by placing an element in each HTML Document.

The rel attribute of the tag must be set to "stylesheet" and the href attribute to the relative or absolute value. path to style sheet. While the use of relative URL paths is generally considered good practice, absolute paths can be used as well. In HTML5, the type attribute can be omitted.

It is recommended that the tag be placed in the tag of the HTML file so that the styles are loaded before the elements they design. Otherwise, users will see a flash of unstyled content. </p>

              <article class="caption"> <b> Internal styles..</b>
                <p> Tagged CSS within an HTML document works like an external style sheet, except that it lives in the HTML document you design rather than in a separate file, and therefore can only be applied to the document you live in. Note that this element must be inside the element for HTML validation (although it will work in all current browsers if placed in the body). </p>

              <article class="caption"> <b> Styles online. </b>
                <p> Use inline styles to style a specific element. Note that this is not optimal. Placing style rules in a &lt;Style&gt; External CSS file or tag is recommended to maintain a distinction between content and presentation. Inline styles override any CSS in an external &lt;Style&gt; tag or style sheet. While this can be useful in some circumstances, this fact often reduces the maintainability of a project. The styles in the following example are applied directly to the elements to which they are associated.

Inline styles are generally the safest way to ensure rendering compatibility across multiple email clients, programs, and devices, but they can be time consuming to write and a bit difficult to manage. </p>
